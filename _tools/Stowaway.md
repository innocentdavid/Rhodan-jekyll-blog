  is a Multi-hop proxy tool for security researchers and pentesters. Users can easily proxy their network traffic to intranet nodes (multi-layer),break the restrction and manipulate all the nodes that under your control

    Features - 
    - More user-friendly interaction, support command auto-completion/search history
    - Obvious node topology
    - Clear information display of nodes
    - Active/Passive connection between nodes
    - Support reconnection between nodes
    - Nodes can be connected through socks5 proxy
    - Nodes can be connected through ssh tunnel
    - TCP/HTTP can be selected for inter-node traffic
    - Multi-hop socks5 traffic proxy forwarding, support UDP/TCP, IPV4/IPV6
    - Nodes can access arbitrary host via ssh
    - Remote shell
    - Upload/download files
    - Port local/remote mapping
    - Port Reuse
    - Open/Close all the services arbitrarily
    - Authenicate each other between nodes
