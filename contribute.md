# <font color="#881FE9">Mode of Communication</font> 

The preferred mode of communication is via [Discord](https://discord.gg/NBe99QQ2t5); other mediums include [Twitter](https://twitter.com/killswitchx7) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhartha-shree-kaushik). Pull requests would be too hectic, so just bringing attention to the tool would be enough.

**`NOTE:`** Rhodan strictly follows its [objectives](/about/#objectives-of-this-tool). 

Any deviation from the well-defined objective is not an acceptable entry for the tools.

For the sake of simplicity, I have set up a dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NBe99QQ2t5). Once you have joined the server, just post a message in **<font color="#E9961F"> #general</font>**  stating that you want the **<font color="#E9961F">Tool Creator</font>** role. Once the moderator assigns you the role, you can then share your tool in the **<font color="#E9961F">tools channel</font>**. If the shared tool receives an emoji (which is Rhodan's logo essentially) from the moderator (as of now it's me only) then the tool gets added to Rhodan.

Communicating via other mediums is pretty straightforward; just post a message with your tool. Discord has some advantages, as like-minded tool creators would often be sharing tools and might collaborate on creating great tools. One can hangout and shit-post as well. As of now the discord server is not designed for anything else than the tool's purpose, but if community demands more addition then I would happily do that. 

Any change to the requirements will be updated here, as well as the Discord server.
