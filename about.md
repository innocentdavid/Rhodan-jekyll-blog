<h1 align="center"> What is Rhodan? </h1>
---

Rhodan is a web-based interactive GUI tool for centralized management of all the various tools and resources related to the Cybersecurity Industry. It encompasses various domains such as red and blue teaming, blogs related to them, videos, exploit POCs, etc.

<font color="#e5d09a"> The number of tools listed in Rhodan grows over time; this does not necessarily mean that it covers all tools previously published, nor does it guarantee that it will cover all tools that come after it. </font>

### <font color="#881FE9">Objectives of this tool:</font> 

Noise-free, aesthetic, and centralized management for a variety of tools in the cybersecurity industry. Rhodan will not incorporate tools that are essentially reinventing the wheel, but if it has some striking differences, added functionality, and/or enhancements, Rhodan will include it in the parent tool for reference.

Rhodan will not be bloated in any sense. Furthermore, Rhodan is not an exclusive list of tools; it is encouraged to publish tools in the community and attempt to register a [contribution](/contribute) here.

<h1 align="center"> The Motivation </h1>

### <font color="#881FE9">Motivation for this project:</font> 


Being active on social media platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn, I often found myself overwhelmed by the amount of new tools being shared by the accounts like <a href="https://twitter.com/santosomar">Omar Ωr Santos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ptracesecurity">Ptrace Security GmbH</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/KitPloit">☣ KitPloit - Hacker Tools
</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberWarship">Florian Hansemann</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cyb_detective">Cyber Detective</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Dinosn">Nicolas Krassas</a>. They are consistent in the amount of new tools, resources, blogs, and Exploit POCs they publish; often, these tools are **<font color="#F6EC1D"> scenario-based</font>**. Now, when doing a red team engagement, one might come across a similar scenario and these tools could be of great help. <font color="#e5d09a">Rhodan is developed to increase the efficiency of the process of finding these relevant tools</font>, which would help in those scenarios.   

### <font color="#881FE9">What would motivate me to continue this project?</font> 

Rhodan is a community-driven tool. Hopefully, people who collaborate on this project will enhance its capabilities, and, as usual, community love and support will be a motivating factor to continue this project.

<h1 align="center"> The Inspiration </h1>
---

Rhodan is inspired by the enthusiastic and hard-working community efforts that push great tools and resources. Thanks to all of the tool creators, they make our lives a little easier.

### <font color="#881FE9">Inspiration for website?</font> 


A CLI-based tool would have been bulky and with a lesser degree of customization, applying filters would have been difficult too, so a website was created instead. Rhodan's website design is heavily inspired from the [WADComs](https://wadcoms.github.io/) project. 

### <font color="#881FE9">Inspiration for the name "Rhodan"?!</font> 

The name "Rhodan" gets its inspiration from the fire demon Rodan, which appeared in the movie Godzilla: King of the Monsters.

<h1 align="center"> The Benefits </h1>
---

1. A centralized resource that can easily be searched and has a variety of options to customize your search. 
2. Do more than just hoard the tools; they can be forgettable and hard to parse through.
3. It's Rhodan, after all; it evolves over time (updated frequently) and strictly adheres to its objectives.
